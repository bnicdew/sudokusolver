# SudokuSolver

Description: Created to solve any 9x9 standard sudoku board supplied or detect whether the sudoku board is impossible to solve. This project was done entirely in C++ as the combination of the language's natural flexibility in addition to my familiarity with it made it perfect for this simple project.

Run/Installation:
This project must be downloaded and run alongside one of the provided .txt sudoku boards, or with a custom created one in the same format. The path file for the sudoku board in Sudoku.cpp must be changed accordingly depending on the file used.

Future Plans:
  - Change to no longer need a .txt file and can solve a sudoku board that is directly provided.
